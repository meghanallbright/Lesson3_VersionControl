            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are used by almost everyone who works on code, development teams and individuals alike.  These systems are used to manage changes to a programmer’s work and save different versions of it so that nothing gets lost. The systems easily allow different versions of the documents or programs to be retrieved. While many individuals use these systems to organize their work, version control systems are especially important for people working on teams and in groups. It is essential for teams to use some type of version control system because they allow multiple people to work on the documents simultaneously. Additionally, one person can work on a project, save the changes, upload it to the version control system in use, and later another person in the group can come along later and add to it. Because the system saves all the versions, even though someone else came along and made changes, the original person’s work is still there and can be accessed if something goes wrong with the second person’s work. Without these types of version control systems it would be extremely difficult as well as inefficient to try and keep track of all the work done on a project.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In version control systems users deal with both local repositories and remote repositories.  One example of, and arguably one of the most used, version control system and remote repository is GitHub. Users upload their files from their local repository into the remote repository GitHub. Beginning in 2005 GitHub has been known for its speed, simple design, ability to handle large projects and being fully distributed. GitHub is an open source project which means that the original source code is freely available. For individual users, GitHub is free of charge unless you choose to upgrade your account. Unlike any other version control systems Git thinks of data as snapshots. Every time you save your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of it rather than store the information as a bunch of different files. A great thing about Git is that it is impossible to make even the smallest change without Git knowing about it. This prevents the loss of files without detection. The three main stages of Git are committed, modified, and staged. Committed is when the data stored, modified is when there have been changes made but the file has not been committed, and staged is when a file has been marked to go into the next commit snapshot.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To be able to successfully use Git a user must first know somethings about how to work it. In Git, there are several different, commonly used, basic commands. These commands include git init, git add, git commit, git log, git status. Git init creates a new local repository, git add adds the files, and git commit commits any files you added as well as any files you’ve changed. Git log shows all commits and git status lists the files that have been changed and the ones that still need to be added or committed. There are also 3 remote commands, git remote, git pull, and git push, that deal more with the remote repository side of things. Git remote connects to the remote repository, git pull retrieves and merges changes on the remote server to the working directory, and git push pushes all files to the remote repository. The commands make up a good part of the things you need to know how to do in order to successfully use the Git version control system. Without the basic knowledge of these commands Git would be virtually useless and would do no good in the user’s efforts to organize their different documents and files.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The basic steps in putting files onto the remote repository are 1) add, 2) commit, and 3) push. The commands for these actions are git add, git commit, and git push. The first step is to add the files that have been changed. This step is similar to putting you items in a shopping cart, you are getting ready to “buy” them. In this case “buy” is equivalent to putting the files in the staging area. The next step is to commit the files. This is basically recording the changes to the local repository. This step would be equivalent to taking your items to the cash register. Finally, the last step is to push the files to the remote repository. This will make the files available to the other users’ local repositories that are connected to the same remote repository. This last step is analogous to finally buying your items. If all steps are done correctly, the updated files should be located in the remote repository and can be accessed, or pulled, to any local repository that is connected to it, allowing multiple people to work on the files, add the changed ones, commit them, and finally push them to the remote repository.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In version control systems, there are two kinds of repositories, local and remote. A local repository is one that is on the local machine of the individual user using it. A local repository can be created one of two ways: create a brand new one or clone a remote repository onto the local machine. A remote repository is one that is located on a remote server that can be shared with multiple member of a development team. Remote repositories are used to exchange files between multiple local repositories, which is how different members of a development team or group can work on the same files, even at the same time, without fear of losing a version of a file or all the files together. As discussed earlier GitHub deals with both local and remote repositories to store files and documents. Changes are first stored in the local repository and then later stored in the remote repository using the git push command. The git pull command pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local repository which is how a member of a team would be able to edit something another team member had already edited.
